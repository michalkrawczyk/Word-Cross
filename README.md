# Word-Cross
Made as University exercise console application 

Basing on data from config.txt creates arena with specified ammount of random words loaded from "słowa.txt" and random characters.

Then Naive solves it , highlight words that has been found and prints them

Application is working properly , but propably will be extended in future with:
- Rabin–Karp algorithm
- different colors for every word in solution
